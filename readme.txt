================================================================================

Vamonos is a library for generating browser-based visualizations of algorithms
& data structures. Here are some reasons why we think Vamonos is great:

    No installation barrier. Visualizations run on any modern browser using
    standard Javascript. No plugins or extensions are needed.

    Self-containment. Visualizations do not require any server-side
    interaction.  Your browser doesn’t even have to be connected to the
    internet.  Visualizations can even be “compiled” into a self-contained HTML
    file that can be easily distributed to students.

    Interaction. Students can easily provide their own inputs to an algorithm,
    set breakpoints & watchpoints, and step backwards & forwards through the
    algorithm’s execution.

    Extensibility. If you can implement an algorithm in Javascript, then you
    can easily make a Vamonos visualization for that algorithm. We currently
    support dynamic display of array and graph data structures.

    Appearance. Our default visualization styles are beautiful and natively
    scalable using your browser’s zoom feature. Of course, if you are handy
    with CSS, you can also easily style a visualization to meet your needs.

Vamonos is developed in the EECS department of Oregon State University. It was
started while the project leader was in the Computer Science department at the
University of Montana. The name “Vamonos” doesn’t really have to be an
acronym, but if it were, its expansion would be Visualizing Algorithms from
Montana and Oregon State.

Vamonos is developed with support from NSF award #1149647. Any opinions,
findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are

                                Basic Usage
================================================================================

To get started, you’ll need to make an HTML file that includes links to the
following things:

    Vamonos Javascript file
    Vamonos default CSS file

You can do that by including the following lines in your HTML file’s <head>
section:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/vamonos.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/vamonos-all.js"></script>

You can follow our guide to creating visualzations at:

    http://rosulek.github.io/vamonos/guide

We also recommend deconstructing some of our pre-made demos, available at:

                             Version History
================================================================================

v2.0.0 : released 4-8-2014
--------------------------

API
* Graph - change styleEdges to edgeCssAttributes - use css to style paths.
* New Widget - ResultProperty. Provide it with a mapping from
  qualified variable names to a side-effecting functions that take
  their variable as input. It will call the functions at displayStart
  event, using the final frame of the visualization.
* ArrayGuts - new constructor argument "firstCellBlank". Adds
  left-margin of 26px to array, for aligning 1-indexed with 0-indexed
  arrays.
* ArrayGuts - new constructor argument "maxInputLength". Allows custom
  limit to the length of the value in each cell.
* CallStack - new constructor argument "formatArgumentValues"
* CallStack - new constructor argument "formatReturnValue"

DEMOS
* Simplified Longest Increasing Subsequence
* Karatsuba Multiplication
* Recursive Addition
* Dijkstra's Quiz

GUTS
* Reimplemented the graph widget using d3.
* If hash-string decode fails, load Vamonos normally
* Set titles on all demos
* Overwrite history entry when a new querystring is appended to url
* Added LZW compression to the querystring
* When user pushes the "Run" button the browser location is updated to
  reflect the current state of the visualization inputs.
* New event: "externalInput", sends parsed JSON object from query
  string. Which should be a stringified inputScope from the
  Visualizer. Graphs and Arrays support saved input states.
* Vamonos.arrayToNum and .numToArray - methods for translating back
  and forth between 1234 and [1,2,3,4].* When user pushes the "Run"

v1.2.1 : released 1-13-2014
---------------------------

New Demos
    * Stoogesort
    * Bellman-Ford Shortest Path
    * Krustal's Minimum Spanning Tree
    * Strongly Connected Components

New Features
    * Created disjoint set data structure
    * Visualizer: maxCallStackSnapshotDepth: set the max depth that
      callstack snapshots will be taken at when it is set as a watchvar
    * Graph data structure - eachVertexBy and eachEdgeBy can take custom
      comparators
    * Graph vertexCssAttributes can take a function
    * Added tablet support

Bug Fixes
    * Graph gets hidden instead of tore down when it goes out of scope
    * Edges in directed graphs reuse the jsplumb connection when
      switching direction
    * Added Vamonos.createNColorClasses
    * API: Show default values that are functions as `[function]` instead
      of `undefined`.
    * Removed extra spin through loop in maxflow and bipartite matching
      demos.
    * The setup event sends widgets a callback that they call when they
      are done setting up. this is to allow jsPlumb to load
      asynchronously.
    * Fixed: Creating a potential edge that needed a new connection would
      cause all the endpoints on the source vertex to flip 180 degrees
    * Cloned undirected graphs had edges that weren't accessible from
      both edge(source,target) and edge(target,source)
    * Updated jsPlumb to 1.5.5 and jQuery to 2.0.3


v1.2.0 : released 12-14-2013
----------------------------

Breaking Changes:
    * Graph: edgeLabel is no longer used for setting default edge attr values

Changes:
    * created a page that lists all of our demos - demos/index.html
    * mergesort demo
    * dialed in ford-fulkerson
    * api is sorted alphabetically
    * new array "showCellNumber" option - now you can turn off the
      numbers above each array element (nice for queues)
    * pseudocode uses monospace font
    * subscript available in VarName and Graph variables as "name_sub"
    * demos got prettier

Bugfixes:
    * VarDisplay and Array maintain consistent height
    * arrays that ignore index zero can come in and out of scope
    * graph has 'showChanges' option
    * graph now prevents creation of nodes outside graph container
    * going to display mode after a graph element was selected caused
      strange resizing of graph
    * bidirectional edges in directed graphs got some fixes


v1.1.0 : released 11-14-2013
----------------------------

Additions:
    * a new premade demo: Ford-Fulkerson Max Flow!
    * an error checking phase of visualization - new "checkErrors" event
    * a new error widget for custom error cases
    * graph widget got an "editable" option for view-only graphs
    * graph data structure got a new toString method
    * edgeLabel can be specific to display/edit mode
    * edgeLabel can take a function - in which case it won't be editable
    * graph widget - collapse bidirectional edges in directed graphs - both
      directions have individually editable attributes

Bugfixes:
    * with multiple inputVars to the graph widget in edit mode - only the
      final one was modifiable
    * graph widget - removed unnecessary clearing of graph
    * new vertices are centered at click for all vertex sizes
    * potential edge in directed graph uses existing incoming edge instead
      of creating a new edge
